EventNova is an Event Management mobile application developed as a part of Software Engineering course 2025. Currently, club admins have to go through a long venue booking process, and must send event booking requests atleast 10 days in prior followed by multiple visits to the management's office to get their event approved. With EventNova, event creation and approval are just a few clicks away, eliminating all effort and paperwork.
